After create the calendar app, i decided to make a app that auto generates content based on an array containing information (wanted to use classes at first but ran into problems using typescript, the goal is to use classes on the final product).

OBJECTIVE:
* use typescript
* functional "add to cart" and "remove from cart"
* make it mobile resposive by using media query
